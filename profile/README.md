# Welcome to stuyai



stuyai is Stuyvesant's Artifical Intelligence Club. We hope to help the school through both applying AI to school projects and teaching students about AI/ML ideas and how to apply them.

## Charter

### Mission Statement

stuyai aims to teach anyone, including complete beginners, how to make and improve their own meaningful machine learning models as they learn about AI.

### Purpose

  Throughout the past few years, everybody (even those living under rocky rocks) has seen the advancements of AI and its increasing number of applications in society. AI's novelty and power can make it seem overwhelming and complex, making it seem intimidating enough to lead people to believe that learning about artificial intelligence or developing models and projects is infeasible, too costly, or simply enormously tricky. People could even start to fear artificial intelligence or, even worse, believe in it mindlessly.

  In this club, we aim to combat this by teaching concepts and guiding our members as they collaborate, construct, and compete with a focus on AI, with a focus on integrating knoweldge and usability. Through weekly lessons, we teach students to tackle issues that impact society in general and this school. We teach our members AI-related concepts, discussing their importance, benefits, shortcomings, and growth prospects while also giving ways to implement them through code. StuyAI does this with engaging lessons, games, tasks, and discussions. AI is not just for the programming geeks or TensorFlow tryhards. It's for everybody, and thus, it should be accessible to everyone, regardless of programming level. That's why this club has two separate lessons each week, one for anyone interested in AI and another for people who want to learn about using it in greater depth, learning specific techniques and application ideas. Even those with experience with artificial intelligence can learn more and join a community of people venturing into the vast world of artificial intelligence. AI does not exist in a vacuum; its application determines its potency.
  
  Beyond that, the community benefits when a group of students have a deeper understanding of AI. Anyone today needs to understand what is happening in AI; therefore, we aim to educate as many people as possible. Our club’s most important goal is to spread knowledge. This club grows awareness of AI outside its member base and even the broader community. This is done through events, fun facts, and projects that look to the larger community.


### Benefits of stuyai to the school

  stuyai benefits its members and the school community by spreading knowledge about a ever growing area, creating a community for focused learners, and producing projects to help the school. It is not only for enthusiasts to have fun. stuyai is for the entire school community and is meant to bring knowledge of AI to the whole student body. Our members will develop valuable programming, data analysis, and problem-solving skills through projects, lessons, and other activities. Our members can use AI tools more effectively due to a deep understanding of what’s happening behind the curtains when they type a prompt for a large language model or an image generator. As they attend more meetings and complete club projects, they will continue to grow their understanding of AI's immediate and long-term impact, including how it could be applied in their future career. Most importantly, they will be able to develop an understanding of AI to filter through what they hear and see online. Beyond that, the knowledge gained could also help them create their own AI projects, which they can use to improve the world around them. 

  No matter the experience level, knowledge about artificial intelligence will benefit the individual who has it and, by extension, the people around them. stuyai is what its leaders wish they had when they started learning AI. Self-studying a topic such as AI is frustrating and challenging, making it hard to gain motivation or affirmation. This club helps provide a way for people to connect with others interested in AI and struggle through a challenge together. All our lessons have different levels, so we will ensure that you are always slightly challenged but not overwhelmed. Our club offers you a chance to learn something you may not have considered exploring befor, while equipping you with the resources you need to ultimately make you feel accomplished after learning a challenging topic. Beyond the individual members, Stuyvesant as a whole will benefit from this club. Every year, we will have at least one project focusing on helping the school community. It could be anything, from a classifier to determine where you should put your trash to checking the escalators. As a school renowned for its strength in STEM, Stuyvesant is missing a large community where people can gain an understanding of AI, which we provide.
